# Guess-The-Movie

A Java mini-project in which the player has to guess a movie's name randomly generated from a pre-defined list of movies.
The player can only make 10 wrong guesses. If the player can guess the movie's name before making 10 wrong guesses, then he/she wins.
Otherwise, the player loses the game. This is very similar to the popular game of **_Hangman_**.
